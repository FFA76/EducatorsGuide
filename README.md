# EducatorGuide

The PhyPiDAQ project aims to provide student access to state-of-the-art measurement technology and data acquisition
tools. As it is based on standardized protocols and hardware, it can not only be cheaper to set up than similar offers
but also give a great educational introduction in methods of modern science. Additionally, the measuring technology
can be run off a power bank, making it portable and allowing great experiments in nature. It targets students from
middle school up to undergraduates at the university level with great matching educational concepts. Looking beyond
school it is also an amazing base for STEM based competitions like
"[Jugend forscht](https://www.jugend-forscht.de/information-in-english.html)" or science fairs.

This is the guide for educators. If you are looking for hardware guides, build instructions or software, please check
